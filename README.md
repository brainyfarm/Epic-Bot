# Slack Genius

_A Slackbot that searches genius.com_

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to make a Slackbot that receives input through a [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) and sends a request to an API.

    heroku config:add GENIUS_ACCESS=[your access token]

<!-- TODO: Add more here -->
